          <h1>Understanding News Domain </h1>
          <p>In this, we will cover what News is at its core and learn things that we should be aware of. While building
            it is not just about the users but also about the domain itself so this will give you a good understanding
            of
            what news is all about.</p>
          <p>Note: This is a summarized version of what we have learned after researching. Please note there is more to
            news than what we can write here so if you wish to learn more please check the sources page to discover the
            articles and videos that we have learned from. Have Fun :D</p>
